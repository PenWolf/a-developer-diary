in this diary , you will find every single note and remark i do , on my long road of learning the software development .
You will find the tutorials with their links and my notes in single files as notes.txt for every lesson i learn , from youtube , E-learning platforms and books.
Subjects will vary from frontend UX/UI to Backend development and in different subjects , but most of the content you will find is about python and javascript cause
i admire them .
Remember two keys for learning anything in the earth :
1/ Do not worry about being a student again no matter how old are you or how much your experience is .
2/ practice makes perfect

Hope you will enjoy what you read and good luck for every Computer Science learner and student .
